    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      These home fries turn out crispy every time. They're great for breakfast
      or as a side dish. If you prefer crispy hash browns, use shredded potatoes
      (instead of cubed) and follow the recipe directions.
    </p>

      <li>3 medium russet potatoes, cubed</li>
